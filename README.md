# BASH-JAM-I

### Collection of simple bash scripts written in a week by the team members.


#### This is **BASH-JAM** Version One.
- BASH-JAM is an idea to practice bash scripting in a competetive way, where you have to create a useful tool in a limited time.
- BASH-JAM version 1 is for OSC-Linux members only.
- I hope the next versions will have more contributions, which will be public for everyone who sees the beauty of bash.

## How to Contribute ? 

- choose an idea from this [list](Scripts-Ideas.md)
- you can choose any other idea but you have to write it in the ideas file in the same format.
- Write the bash script
- beside the script create a README.md file describing the script input/output/usage/ what does the script do and your name as a hyberlink to your github account
